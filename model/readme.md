### Recent Updates
[2019.8.1]

If you want to get our all models and logs, please download from [https://pan.baidu.com/s/11RslAFW9g7kS8I4IVZC_Iw](https://pan.baidu.com/s/11RslAFW9g7kS8I4IVZC_Iw), and passward code is ```7iic```.
Then you can save it to ./model.

### Test
If you have our model and official test-set, you need to set official test-set pictures to '/AmurTigerReID/database/test/'

You only change the test.py as follow:

```
net = tiger_cnn1(classes=107)   # please change the target model name
net.load_state_dict(torch.load('./model/tiger_cnn1/model.ckpt')['net_state_dict'])  # please change the target model path
```

And then, you can run the test.py to get result.json.
